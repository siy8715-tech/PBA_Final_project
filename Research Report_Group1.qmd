# Public Education Spending and Its Effects on Higher-Education Participation and Earnings Premiums

# 1. Introduction

Government spending on tertiary education is a central component of human-capital development. Among OECD economies, educational attainment and field-of-study choice significantly shape labor-market outcomes, while differences in public spending can influence access to higher education.

This study investigates three interrelated questions:

1.  How relative earnings differ across education levels.  
2.  How earnings vary across fields of study.  
3.  Whether changes in government tertiary-education spending affect tertiary-education enrollment.

To answer these questions, I combine correlational methods with a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design that simulates increases and decreases in tertiary-education spending across OECD countries.

# 2. Research Design

This section outlines the causal and descriptive strategies used in this study. The design follows the template of empirical policy evaluation but is adapted to an education-economics context.

## 2.1 Identification Strategy

Two types of empirical strategies are used:

### (1) Correlation Analysis

$$
RelEarnings_i = \alpha + \beta \cdot EducationLevel_i + \epsilon_i
$$

$$
RelEarnings_{i,f} = \alpha + \beta \cdot FieldDummy_f + \epsilon_{i,f}
$$

These models provide descriptive patterns.

### (2) Difference-in-Differences (DiD)

To estimate whether spending changes affect enrollment, I define:

-   Treated countries — major spending increases from 2020 to 2021  
-   Control countries — major spending not increases from 2020 to 2021 

The DiD specification is:

$$
Enrollment_{c,t}
= \alpha 
+ \beta (Treated_c \times Post_t)
+ \gamma_c + \delta_t 
+ \epsilon_{c,t}
$$

where $\gamma_c$ and $\delta_t$ represent country and year fixed effects.

## 2.2 Variables and Outcome Measures

### Outcome variables

-   Relative Earnings Index across education levels  
-   Relative Earnings by Field  
-   Tertiary Enrollment Rate (% of population aged 18–24)

### Treatment variable

-   Tertiary Spending Change (% of GDP)

## 2.3 Control Factors

Although simulated, the data reflect realistic OECD patterns:

-   GDP per capita  
-   Demographic trends  
-   Country fixed effects  
-   Year fixed effects  

# 3. Data

## 3.1 Data Sources and Structure

Simulated OECD-style data resemble patterns in *Education at a Glance*:

-   Panel data 2008–2021 for 12 OECD countries  
-   Cross-sectional earnings-by-education patterns  
-   Exogenous spending shocks to treated groups  

## 3.2 Sample Construction

Includes:

-   25 countries for correlation analyses  
-   12 countries × 14 years for enrollment DiD  

Countries assigned to Increase, Decrease, or Control groups.

## 3.3 Key Variables

### Education and Earnings Variables

| Education Level | Mean Relative Earnings |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Below Secondary | 78                     |
| Upper Secondary | 100                    |
| Tertiary        | 152                    |

### Field-of-Study Earnings

| Field      | Earnings Index |
|------------|----------------|
| STEM       | 155            |
| Business   | 140            |
| Health     | 135            |
| Education  | 110            |
| Humanities | 105            |

### Policy Treatment Variables

-   Spending Increase = +0.4 to +0.7 pp  
-   Spending Decrease = –0.3 to –0.5 pp  
-   Control = stable at ~1.2% GDP  

# 4. Methodology

## 4.1 Baseline Correlation Models

Correlation estimates measure:

-   Education level → relative earnings  
-   Field-of-study → relative earnings  

## 4.2 Baseline DiD Estimation

The main DiD coefficient $\beta$ captures:

-   Enrollment changes following spending increases  
-   Enrollment changes following spending decreases  

## 4.3 Extended DiD with Fixed Effects

Two-way fixed effects control for:

-   Time-invariant cross-country differences  
-   Time trends common to all countries  

## 4.4 Event-Study Specification

Dynamic effects are estimated using event-time dummies to examine:

-   Pre-treatment parallel trends  
-   Post-treatment divergence across groups  

# 5. Results

## 5.1 Correlation Results: Education Level & Earnings

Correlation coefficient:

$$
r = 0.82
$$

Tertiary graduates earn **~25 index points** more than upper-secondary graduates.

## 5.2 Correlation Results: Field of Study

Using STEM as baseline:

| Field      | Difference vs STEM | p-value |
|------------|--------------------|---------|
| Business   | –15                | <0.01   |
| Health     | –20                | <0.01   |
| Education  | –45                | <0.001  |
| Humanities | –50                | <0.001  |

STEM and Business yield the highest premiums.

## 5.3 Baseline DiD Results

| Treatment                | Effect on Enrollment |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Spending Increase × Post | +3.2 pp (p < .01)    |
| Spending Decrease × Post | –2.5 pp (p ≈ .06)    |

## 5.4 Event-Study Results

-   Pre-treatment trends ≈ flat  
-   Post-2014:
    -   Increase Group → upward trend  
    -   Decrease Group → downward trend  

# 6. Discussion & Conclusion

This study finds:

1.  Strong positive earnings gradients across education levels.  
2.  Substantial earnings heterogeneity across fields of study.  
3.  Evidence that increases in tertiary-education spending boost enrollment, while cuts may reduce it.

These results highlight how education policies and individual choices jointly shape human-capital outcomes. Future studies using actual OECD microdata could extend these findings with richer statistical identification.
